- Disadvantages
  - Noise and Traffic Concerns: Proximity to starports may raise concerns among nearby residential areas regarding noise pollution and increased traffic. Strategies to address these concerns and foster community acceptance will be essential. Travelers would prefer the starports to be located close to major cities but many survey respondents expressed a dislike for the idea of living near a starport.
  - Limited Control over CO2 Emissions: While efforts can be made to minimize the carbon footprint of rocket travel, the inherent nature of space travel may still result in significant emissions. Educating passengers about ongoing efforts to reduce emissions and exploring potential offsets can help alleviate concerns.
